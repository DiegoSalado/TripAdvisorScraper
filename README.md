# Data_Analist_Challenge

## Trully challenge for Jr. Data Analysts.
This is a end-to-end solution for the challenge to do the following:

- Scrap information from TripAdvisor Mexico (www.tripadvisor.com.mx). We’re looking for information regarding restaurants in Mexico, the latitude and longitude, number of reviews, ranking, etc... Get as much information as you can.
- Clean and treat the data.
- Have fun and go through a data mining process to generate new variables from the scraped data.
- Which insights did you find most interesting from the data?
- Generate deliverables for the data engineering team: python scripts, and csv files.
